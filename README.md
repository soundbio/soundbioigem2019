# SoundBio iGEM 2019 GitHub Page
This is the GitHub page for the [SoundBio iGEM 2019](https://sound.bio/soundblog/2018/3/12/igem-2018) team. 

## Software
The majority of the code found on this page will be relating to the software team. Their job is to build computational models for the experiments the wetlab and hardware teams run, using actual data from both of those teams.

This year, the software team worked on creating a model for the Red Light Circuit. The model was based on Dr. Jeffrey Tabor's model as described in this paper (https://www.embopress.org/doi/10.15252/msb.20167456). 

## Hardware
The hardware team on SoundBio iGEM is responsible for creating any machinery that will be used during the season -- sensors, bioreactors, etc.

## Wetlab
Wetlab is where the bulk of the lab work takes place. They are the ones who carry out the majority of the experiments.
