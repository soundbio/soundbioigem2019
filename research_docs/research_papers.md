* Keywords: Bioreactor optimization, gradients from mca
* This paper discusses a way to optimize production in bioreactors using metabolic control analysis and gradients - maybe we can modify this to create a control feedback??
* Google Doc - <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xK8Kih0fW-uLTYBGus8ZJL-SWLxFLPjVpRO0IhMS23E/edit#>

## Control Feedback

1. Modeling of control feedback loop
