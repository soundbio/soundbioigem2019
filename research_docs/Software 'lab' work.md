# Software lab work



**Date:** 6/22/2019

**Members:** Hari, Claris (Advisor: Zach)

**Goal:** To set up and test some sensors and connect them with raspberry pi

**What we accomplished:** 

1. We installed raspberry pi noobs onto Hari’s computer and loaded it into onto the SD card
2. We set up the raspberry pi and connected all the things to it (computer, mouse, sd card…)
3. We spent some time debugging the raspberry pi because the monitor was not displaying the raspberry pi - we reinstalled the files onto the sd card and it worked!
4. We set up the actual rasberry pi on the computer
