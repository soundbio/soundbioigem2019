### Arya  

- I looked into time-delay differential equations, their benefits and their vices. Upon further research, DDEs seem very promising. The added complexity is much lower than face value, and they do add an extra level of precision. The main downside at this point is the buttload of extra parameters that it will require.
- I looked into different ways of representing the light variable in the optogenetic cicuits. As of right now, the most promising measurement seems to be photon flux, measured in number of photons per area-second.

### Claris  

* I researched into reinforcement learning models. These models involve creating multiple models and simulations based on real time data. However, I am not sure if this would be considered a  mathematical model because the    code that we would write would not be a model but would create mathematical models in time intervals, I think.
* I also did more research into types of gradient based models. It seems that these involve PDEs and ODEs and have been largely used in bioreactor modeling

### Hari  

* I learned about the Box-Behnken design for optimizing parameters through a smaller number of designed experiments. This seems very borderline software, but could be used with known parameters in models to see what hardware changes effect them.  
* I also researched bubble column reactors, which is the kind of design hardware is going with. These bioreactors have been used in the past to produce bacterial cellulose, and their models are simpler than those of internal loop airlift bioreactors (though they are structured similarly).


### Keerthana  

### Vrishab 

* As per my task on todoist, I delved into finding which genetic circuits we actually need to model. Planting a list of pros and cons enabled me to outline our options, and from there, we can decide as a team as to which method we will approach

* I also looked into what the time delay differential equation modeling would look like. The mathematics involved were quite complex, but I have learned what distinguishes it from the typical PDE/ODE modeling --> I hope to learn more about this during today's meeting.
