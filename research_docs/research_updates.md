* I researched into reinforcement learning models. These models involve creating multiple models and simulations based on real time data. However, I am not sure if this would be considered a  mathematical model because the    code that we would write would not be a model but would create mathematical models in time intervals, I think.
* I also did more research into types of gradient based models. It seems that these involve PDEs and ODEs and have been largely used in bioreactor modeling

* I learned about the Box-Behnken design for optimizing parameters through a smaller number of designed experiments. This seems very borderline software, but could be used with known parameters in models to see what hardware changes effect them.  
* I also researched bubble column reactors, which is the kind of design hardware is going with. These bioreactors have been used in the past to produce bacterial cellulose, and their models are simpler than those of internal loop airlift bioreactors (though they are structured similarly).
