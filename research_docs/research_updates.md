* I researched into reinforcement learning models. These models involve creating multiple models and simulations based on real time data. However, I am not sure if this would be considered a  mathematical model because the    code that we would write would not be a model but would create mathematical models in time intervals, I think.
* I also did more research into types of gradient based models. It seems that these involve PDEs and ODEs and have been largely used in bioreactor modeling
